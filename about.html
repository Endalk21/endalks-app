            <p>
                The IOT Campus Field Advisor and Choice System is designed to assist pre-engineering students

                By providing detailed information about various departments, including curriculum,
                career prospects, and statistics, we aim to bridge the gap between student interests and academic
                reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                This platform serves as a digital guidance counselor, accessible anytime and anywhere,
                ensuring every student finds their right path in the world of technology and engineering.
